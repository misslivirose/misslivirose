I have a passion for working cross-functionally on emerging technologies and my mission is to help everyone have tools and capabilities to build and own their computing experience. I believe that we can collectively build far more creative, inclusive, and equitable realities than what we've demonstrated to date. 

I'm a big fan of open source, XR technology, on-device machine learning, and advocating for ethical product policies that protect user privacy and information. I have a passion for the web and open ecosystems that enable individuals and teams to be empowered to create and deploy technologies that they collectively own. The irony of publishing that sentence on GitHub is not lost on me.
