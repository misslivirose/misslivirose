My name is Liv (she/they) and I'm excited to see you here! 

I'm currently working at AWS on the [Lumberyard game engine](https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/). I have a passion for working at the intersection of game technology and the web and my mission is to help everyone have tools and capabilities to build and own personalized 3D worlds and experiences. Prior to joining Amazon, I worked at Mozilla on [Mozilla Hubs](hubs.mozilla.com), an awesome open-source platform for creating and sharing private 3D meeting spaces in the browser. My GitHub profile has evolved over the years alongside my career. My older repos (circa 2015-16) are mostly open source virtual and augmented reality projects from my time working as a developer evangelist for Microsoft's mixed reality initiatives. From 2017-2019, I worked at a virtual reality "metaverse" startup as an engineering lead on their open source platform, where I worked primarily in C++ and JavaScript to build 3D content and authoring tools. When I joined Mozilla in 2019, I moved into product management, so my work is now more focused on product strategy, vision, and bringing new game technology concepts to market.  

I'm a big fan of open source, emerging technology, and advocating for ethical product policies that protect user privacy and information. From January - March in 2020, I participated in a fellowship with the Aspen Institute and launched [The Digital Afterlife Project](https://digitalafterlife.online), a tech policy project designed to help organizations make better decisions about posthumous data collection and management. I have a passion for the web and open ecosystems that enable individuals and teams to be empowered to create and deploy technologies - if you do too, let's connect (though I'm terrible at responding to email most of the time - Twitter is best!)
